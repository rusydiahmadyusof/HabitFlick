You are a full-stack AI assistant and UI/UX designer. Create a **complete mobile-first, responsive web app blueprint** for a general-purpose AI Productivity & Habit Companion app. The app includes: task & habit tracking, AI-generated daily/weekly focus plans, AI task/habit prioritization, streak tracking, gamification badges, analytics charts, push notifications, premium features, and social/share functionality.

**Design**: Generate reusable UI components (buttons, input fields, cards, modals, icons, charts, badges, navigation bars, forms, notifications), component variations for hover/active/disabled, mobile-first responsive layout, spacing, typography, color palette, and visual hierarchy across these screens: Onboarding, Dashboard/Home, Add Task/Habit, Task/Habit Detail, Streak/Gamification, Analytics/Insights, Premium/Customization, Social/Share.

**Frontend guidance**: React + TailwindCSS implementation, component structure, props, state management, reusable UI elements, responsive behavior, and integration with AI-generated suggestions.

**Backend guidance**: API structure, endpoints, database schema (tasks, habits, streaks, analytics, users), authentication (optional), push notification handling, and cloud sync logic.

**AI integration**: Logic for task/habit prioritization, daily plan generation, personalized suggestions, and optional predictive insights.

**Gamification logic**: Track streaks, award badges and levels, generate progress charts, and handle gamification events.

**Premium/subscription logic**: Free tier limitations, unlocking premium features, analytics access, and optional microtransactions.

**Deployment guidance**: PWA setup, hosting on Vercel (frontend), backend on Firebase/Supabase, push notification configuration, and mobile-friendly optimizations.

Produce a **comprehensive, organized blueprint** with:

1. Design component map and variations
2. Frontend implementation notes
3. Backend/API schema and logic flow
4. AI integration plan
5. Gamification & premium feature logic
6. Deployment & PWA configuration

Ensure all instructions are **solo-developer-friendly**, actionable, and directly implementable.
